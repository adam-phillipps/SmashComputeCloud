# SmashComputeCloud
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SmashComputeCloud is created and managed by the ComputeController.
For now, it has the ability to understand how many instances are needed for the
work that's available and then to create those instances.

Configuration is all handled in the .scc.env file which you can create by copying
the .scc.env.example file and filling in the values that you need.
